The Beagle has a certain ability to sniff things out and tends follow a scent trail wherever it may lead him. In fact, Beagles are used as scent-detection dogs at U.S. airports, where their friendliness allows them to search for weapons, drugs and illegal food items without making passengers nervous the way a larger police dog might.
